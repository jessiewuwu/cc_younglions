                        <p>The question is always asked: How did the Chinatown Community Youths Club and The Chinatown Community Young Lions Inc. come to be?</p>
                        <p>Well it all started with a flag holder.</p>
                        <p>I was 8 years old, in Chinatown walking by a lion dance group. When I was literally grabbed by an elder in the group. He told me to hold the associations “flag” banner. I was excited and scared, but jumped at the chance to participate.</p>
                        <p>I have always wanted to participate in a Lion Dance group. But all the established groups were either a Chinese family association, or martial arts schools. Joining either was not something I was interested in. So, I did the next best thing. I started my own lion club with the support of my family, friends, and some influential local businessmen. My goal was to make Lion dance available to anyone regardless of their ethnicity who wanted to participate and learn the traditions of Asian culture and customs without being obligated to one of the Chinese family associations or martial arts schools.</p>
                        <p>(The Club) was founded in 1973, in the basement of a local restaurant and in my parent’s living room. The Clubs name derived from another lion dance group from the 1950’s called Chinatown Community Club. I had family ties with members of C.C.C. so it made sense to pay homage to them. Born the names C.C.Y. & C.C.Y.L.</p>
                        <p>I came to know a restaurant owner/chef named Peter Wong.  He owned the Mandarin Inn restaurant at 14 Mott Street. In time we had struck up a sort of kinship, through Lion dance. One day a fire broke out inside the Mandarin Inn and I helped by pulling the firebox on the corner. Peter was very grateful for my actions and gifted me with a brand new lion head, drum, and other lion dance equipment.</p>
                        <p>I would then organize family, friends, and schoolmates. This would become the nucleus and the beginning of The Club. Peter sponsored us for a number of different performances and my mother Valerie L. Tom (a third generation Chinese-American) would support us and help coordinate our activities. Through her network of business and political affiliations we were able to perform for many venues, businesses, and special events.  Some of our resume includes three Presidents of the United States, two New York Governors and five New York City Mayors, as well as local New York City Council members and District Leaders.</p>
                        <p>45 years have passed since I carried that banner. Never would I have imagined how important and critical this organization has been to the community and most importantly to all the youths that have passed through our doors.  The Club has been a “safe harbor” for many. Lending a sense of belonging, identity, and to others it was a deterrent to gang activity and violence that plague the Chinese community throughout the 70’s, 80’s and 1990’s.</p>
                        <p>We helped hundreds of kids many who were “latch key” kids, through some of their most difficult challenges that face urban inner city youths. Many of which have grown up and moved on to become successful adults in all fields of profession. Many have found life partners and life-long friendships. Many have come back with their children and continue to participate and support our activities throughout the year.</p>
                        <p>We were then and still now that “safe harbor” and all are welcome. Thank you to all that have supported The Club through these years and to all that continue to stay in support of The Club, without them, the support of our families and without you, there would be no club.</p>
                        <p>Best wishes for a healthy, happy and prosperous year.</p>
                        <p>- Warm Regards, Brian</p>
