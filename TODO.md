## Fix
**Nav Bar**
- Mobile nav #mobile-dropdown has to disappear when the main nav appears. The hamburger icon is also there next to History

- Make submenus closer to to the parent link

**Featured in**
- Add preview thumbnails and play icon for videos to replace YouTube's default thumbnail.

**Gallery**
- Remove the duplicate nav_bar for gallery page. Since this is a nested directory, the nav_bar paths don't work. Need to find a way to share one file but make the paths work no matter where the files are.
