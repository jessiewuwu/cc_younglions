# chinatown community young lions
A complete new look and feel for the lion dance group [Chinatown Community Young Lions](http://www.cyounglions.org/)

This is a passion project I picked up after seeing the group perform in 2017 Lunar New Year Festival in Chinatown, Manhattan. Wanting to contribute in any way, I reached out to help redo their website and volunteer at their lion dance festival events.

I am excited to show my vision of the love, community, and modern day sense of style that they carry into this new website design.

## process
**February 2017**: brainstorming and getting to know the group

**March 2017**: share Photoshopped mockups and discuss next steps/tasks for the organizers (new updated text, high-quality images)
